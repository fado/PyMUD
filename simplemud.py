"""A simple Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game. Players can talk to each
other, examine their surroundings and move between rooms.

Some ideas for things to try adding:
    * More rooms to explore
    * An 'emote' command e.g. 'emote laughs out loud' -> 'Mark laughs
        out loud'
    * A 'whisper' command for talking to individual players
    * A 'shout' command for yelling to players in all rooms
    * Items to look at in rooms e.g. 'look fireplace' -> 'You see a
        roaring, glowing fire'
    * Items to pick up e.g. 'take rock' -> 'You pick up the rock'
    * Monsters to fight
    * Loot to collect
    * Saving players accounts between sessions
    * A password login
    * A shop from which to buy items
